# Simplest MERN App

This is a very simple MERN application so you can start developing your own. It's based on the setup of Shama Hoque in the book *Full-Stack React Projects* (very recommended!). 

In order to run and test it you need to have Node.js, npm and MongoDB installed on your computer. Once installed simply install all dependencies with

```bash
npm install
```

and then run 

```bash
npm run development
```

**NOTE: You need to have mongo running. You can to this from another terminal with `mongod`**

The app is running on `http://localhost:3000`. It has live reloading so you can make any changes both on the server side and the client side and the browser will update instantly. 

It's updated to Babel 7 and Webpack 4 (the book uses deprecated packages).
